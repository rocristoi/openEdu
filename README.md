Welcome to the frontend repository for Openedu, a web application designed for creating completely free digital classbooks. Openedu is tailored primarily for Romania but is versatile enough to be used in all countries that employ a 1-10 grade system. This platform is designed with three types of users in mind: Admins, Teachers, and Students.

## Main Project Description

### Introduction

Openedu simplifies the educational administration process by allowing schools to transition from physical to digital classbooks. With a strong emphasis on user-friendliness, the platform enables quick and efficient management of school data.

### User Roles

- **Admins**: Upon signing up, users will receive Admin accounts. Admin users are guided through an intuitive setup interface. ![See the interface here.](https://i.imgur.com/Q3phsTs.png)
  
- **Teachers and Students**: Once the admin setup is complete, both teachers and students are sent their login credentials via email, allowing them to access the school's new digital classbook system.

### Key Features

- Easy onboarding process through a guided setup interface.
- Bulk upload of students and teachers via Excel files, catering to local preferences for data management in Romania. [See how it works in this video.](https://youtu.be/kYuVkmTwg6M)
  
## Technologies Used

- **React JS** with Vite for compiling.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Firebase** for authentication.
- **PostgreSQL** for storing user data.
